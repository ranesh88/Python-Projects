What is Notion?:
==========================
The Dictionary Definition:

> Notion is an application that provides components such as databases, kanban boards, wikis, calendars and reminders. Users can connect these components to create their own systems for knowledge management, note taking, data management, project management, among others.

A new tool that blends your everyday work apps into one. It's the all-in-one workspace for you and your team. If you wish to know more about it, you can refer to:

- Notion's Wikipedia Page.
- Notion's About Page

Modules Used: 
==========================
### Notion Module:

Notion module is Unofficial Python API client for Notion.so. It also works for both free and as well as paid accounts.

- **It has Object-oriented interface** (mapping database tables to Python classes/attributes)
- **Automatic conversion** between internal Notion formats and appropriate Python objects.
- **Callback system** for responding to changes in Notion(e.g. for triggering actions, updating another API, etc)
- **Local cache of data in a unified data store** *(Note: disk cache now disabled by default; to enable, add `enable_caching=True` when initializing `NotionClient`)*

If you wish to know more about it, you can refer to [**Notion Module** Documentation](https://notion-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py-modindex.html).
