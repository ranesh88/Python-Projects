What is **WhatsApp**?:
==========================
I do not think **WhatsApp** needs an introduction but for those who do now know, **WhatsApp** is a free, multiplatform messaging app that lets you make video and voice calls, send text messages, and more ‚Äî all with just a Wi-Fi connection.

If you wish to know more about it, you can refer to [**WhatsApp** Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp). 

Modules Used: 
==========================
### PyWhatKit Module:

[PyWhatKit](https://pypi.org/project/pywhatkit/) is a Python library with various helpful features. It is an easy to use library which does not requires you to do some additional setup. 

This module has lots of other cool features as well. Feel free and go ahead to explore them or if you wish I can write an article about them.

If you wish to know more about it, you can refer to [**pywhatkit Module** Documentation](https://github.com/Ankit404butfound/PyWhatKit).
