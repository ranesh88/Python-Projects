GIF Introduction::
==========================
he Dictionary defination: 

> A lossless format for image files that supports both animated and static images.

A **GIF** stands for Graphical Interchange Format. 

- **GIFs** are a series of images or soundless video that will loop continuously and doesn't require anyone to press play. We say ‚Äúanimated images‚Äù because GIFs aren‚Äôt really videos.
- Gifs are basically the compressed format of the video and they are used in places where very few colors are used, they are mostly used in logos as such. These gifs are compressed using lossless data compression in-order not to degrade the video quality.
- GIFs are gaining popularity because, like memes, they‚Äôre useful for communicating jokes, emotions, and ideas. These services are integrated into apps like Twitter, and Facebook Messenger, and your phone‚Äôs keyboard, so they‚Äôre just as easy to use as emojis or ‚Äústickers.‚Äù

If you wish to know more about it, you can refer to [GIF Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF). Use this link to navigate to the GIF's Wikipedia Page.

## What is MoviePy?

MoviePy is a Python module for video editing, which can be used for basic operations (like cuts, concatenations, title insertions), video compositing (a.k.a. non-linear editing), video processing, or to create advanced effects. It can read and write the most common video formats, including GIF.

If you wish to know more about it, you can refer to [MoviePy Documentation](https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/). Use this link to navigate to the documentation.

Now that you are aware of GIF and MoviePy basics, we can move forward to the coding section.
