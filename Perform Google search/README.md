## What is  Google search?
   - I do not think Google search needs an introduction here but for those who do not know, Google Search, or simply Google, is a web search engine developed by Google LLC. It is the most used search engine on the World Wide Web across all platforms. 
   - If you wish to know more about it, you can refer to [**Google's Wikipedia Page**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google).

## Modules Used:
   - PyWhatKit Module:
       - [**PyWhatKit**](https://pypi.org/project/pywhatkit/) is a Python library with various helpful features. It is an easy to use library which does not requires you to do some additional setup. 
       - This module has lots of other cool features as well. Feel free and go ahead to explore them or if you wish I can write an article about them.
       - If you wish to know more about it, you can refer to [**pywhatkit Module** Documentation](https://github.com/Ankit404butfound/PyWhatKit).
